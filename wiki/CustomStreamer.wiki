#summary Creating custom streamers.

= Introduction =

If you need to add serialization of custom type that does not implement `Streamable` interface you may define your own streamer class.

= Details =

Create class that extends `Streamer` and redefine `readObject()` and `writeObject()` methods to serialize object in your own manner.

You may also extend one of predefined streamers:
  * `ArrayStreamer` for arrays
  * `CollectionStreamer` for collections
  * `EnumStreamer` for custom enums
  * `MapStreamer` for maps
  * `StructStreamer` for field-based objects

To use new streamer you must register it somewhere in the initialization part of the application:
{{{
...
Streamer.registerStreamer( SomeSpecialClass.class, new MyCustomStreamer() );
...
}}}
Note! You must also register the same serializer at server side.
